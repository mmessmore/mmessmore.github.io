## Books I've Found Helpful

### *The Unix Programming Environment*

This text by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike is a classic.  It strongly reflects the world it was written in in 1984.  That helped me immensely understand why things work the way they do in Unix/Linux.

### *Unix: A History and a Memoir*

This tells the story of Unix squarely from Brian Kernighan's perspective.  20 years into using `awk`, this caused me to really understand it.  It's great technical information, history, and a book about building highly functional teams.
